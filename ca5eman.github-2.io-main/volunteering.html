    <h2>Bread of Life</h2>
    <p>
      The Bread of life is a local food pantry located in Oceanside California.
      During my senior year of highschool I volunteered with them every couple of mornings for about four hours.
      The team I worked with there are the most down to earth people I have met, one of them even gave me an extra snowboard he had lying around.

    <h2>KidsGames</h2>
    <p>
      From 2015 to 2018 I was a small group leader at my local church, North Coast Calvary Chapel, for their summer KidsGames camp.
      I was assigned to help the kidergarten section of the camp which proved to be a unique challenge.
      I kept the children safe and grouped together. Made sure they behaved properly both to each other and the instructors at the camp.
      I will never forget how many extra snacks they let us leaders keep, which definitely kept me sane.
